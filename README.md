# Project Information
This is our first project in this AI course :> <br>
In this project, we apply CSP for solving Crytarithmetic Problem, which is broken down into 4 sub-levels from simple to advance. Each level requires different skills and greater effort.
* level 1: Solve the addition equation or subtraction equation with 2 operands. (TWO + TWO = FOUR)
* level 2: Solve any kind of equation with multiple operands and single operator (+ -).
* level 3: Solve any kind of equation with multiple operands and operators (+ -). We use the parentheses () are used to specify the order of operations.
* level 4: Solve level 3 with the multiplication equation (*).
